Hello fellow humans!

I'm Bruno, a psychologist and cognitive scientist by education, tester by occupation, dad and husband by love. I'm born and raised in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, where I joined the software development industry in 2013. Since then, I have worked in various roles: test manager, test consultant, testing teacher, test automation engineer, manual tester. I like breaking software but improving things is my passion: human interactions, processes, software. Polish, English, TypeScript, Java and Python are the languages I use most often at work.
