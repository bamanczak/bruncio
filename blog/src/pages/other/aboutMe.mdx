<h1>Hey fellow humans!</h1>


I'm Bruno:
- a psychologist and cognitive scientist by education, 
- tester by occupation, 
- <mark>dad</mark> and <mark>husband</mark> by love,
- <mark>copy&paste</mark> developer at night (how do you think I created this site?)

I was born and raised in Poznan, Poland, where I joined the software development industry in 2013. Since then, I have worked in various roles: test manager, test consultant, testing teacher, test automation engineer, manual tester. I like breaking software but improving things is my passion: human interactions, processes, software. Polish, English, TypeScript, Java and Python are the languages I use most often at work.
