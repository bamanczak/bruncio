<h1>Alphabrum (my first book for children)</h1>

## Problem statement

My children love cars. I wanted to teach them new letters. I was unable to find an ABC-book with cars.

## Result

### Outside


### Inside

<div class="flex flex-col min-[768px]:flex-row justify-between items-center ml-1 mb-1 gap-1">
    <Image src={letterFImage} alt="Page from the book, showcasing a Van and letter F (pol. 'Furgonetka')" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
    <Image src={letterKImage} alt="Page from the book, showcasing am Ambulance and letter K (pol. 'Karetka')" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
    <Image src={letterTImage} alt="Page from the book, showcasing a Tractor and letter T" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
    <Image src={letterYImage} alt="Page from the book, showcasing two bicycles and letter Y" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
</div>

## Tools

I used Midjourney for generating of images. I wanted to create photorealistic images of small toy cars,
as I thought they would better appeal to kids than arbitrary drawings. I believe

I did the custom print (staggering 3 copies) as a photo book from https://www.empikfoto.pl/ I imported
every page of the book as a standalone image, and made it fullpage on each photobook page. The end result
looks like a regular book.

I used my brain for writing of the poems. Of course I tried ChatGPT but at that time it was unable to generate
proper rhymes in Polish. It may yield cool results in English though.

## Next steps

I would like to make few more books in this format. I'm already working on a version about clothes and plants.
Who knows, maybe it's a series that could really get published?
