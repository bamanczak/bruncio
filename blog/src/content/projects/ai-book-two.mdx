<h1>A book about an excavator</h1>

## Problem statement

My youngest son (2yo) loves excavators and books about excavators. It's hard to stop him from tearing out pages from a book.

## Result

### Outside
<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-center items-center ml-1 mb-1 gap-1">
    <Image src={Cover} alt="Cover of the book" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
    <Image src={Inside} alt="Look into inside of the printed book" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
</div>
<br/>
(Snowid is my artistic alias)

### Inside

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-between items-center ml-1 mb-1 gap-1">
    <Image src={Page2} alt="Page 2 of the book" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
    <Image src={Page20} alt="Page 20 of the book" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
    <Image src={Page21} alt="Page 21 of the book" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />

</div>

## Tools

As usual, I used Midjourney for generating of images. This time I wanted to create drawings that look as if
they were drawn by a real artist. I believe the consistency looks awesome. But the details are of course
far off from what a real artist would achieve. The excavator looks differently almost on every image, and
there is little connection between the drawing and the poem.

I found a great option for printing sturdy books for children on CEWE website: https://www.cewe.pl/cewe-fotoksiazka/kids.html
I'm sure this one is not so easy to break :) It's more expensive as well, which made me wonder what are 
the actual costs of printing such books at scale, as such books don't seem to be that much more expensive
in regular bookstores.

I tried ChatGPT again for poems but it still was unable to come up with good rhymes in polish. Brain-based 
solution was again the only option!

However, here I also stumbled upon an interesting challenge, where I had to design **exactly** 22 pages.
This was the only option available on CEWE. With the previous book, I had a freedom of adding as many/little
pages as I wanted. Here I had to have exactly 22 pages, and I assumed that evey one of them should have 4
verses of text. This was a cool way of forcing my brain to think more. But otherwise I would make it slightly
shorter, as some parts seem really off.


## Next steps

I will for sure try to write more poems like this. However creating drawings was really time consuming.
I'll first focus on better quality of text, before printing more like examples like this.

But hey! My son likes it and we read it from time to time. That's what matters the most for me!
