<h1>Hey fellow humans!</h1>

I'm Bruno:
- a psychologist and cognitive scientist by education, 
- tester by occupation, 
- <mark>dad</mark> and <mark>husband</mark> by love,
- <mark>copy&paste</mark> developer at night (how do you think I created this site?)
<br/>

I was born and raised in Poznan, Poland, where I joined the software development industry in 2013. Since then, I have worked in various roles: test manager, test consultant, testing teacher, test automation engineer, manual tester. I like breaking software but improving things is my passion: human interactions, processes, software. Polish, English, TypeScript, Java and Python are the languages I use most often at work.
<br/>

Also, like any other human, I have dreams, hobbies, and preferences (like the fondness of the Oxford Comma, added in this sentence). I wish to convert my bedtime stories to published books for children. I would like to excercise more. Every year I start some kind of a new project that I never finish.
<br/>

I often challenge the status quo. That annoys people. It annoys me that it annoys people. But sometimes I manage to make things better.
<br/>

I would like to make the world a better place. I'm still looking on how to do that. For now I make/test software. Sometimes it makes the world better. Sometimes not.
<br/>
