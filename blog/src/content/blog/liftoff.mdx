This blog is a follow-up to <mark>my tradition of starting a new project every now and then</mark>. And not finishing it.

A decade ago, I started coding an awesome hyper-casual mobile game. I refactored it twice, redesigned it lots of times, fixed countless bugs and... I never pushed it to completion. 

A few years ago, I started a book. It is around 40% complete, yet I have not written even a sentence for a year. 

Last year, I started a newsletter, but after a few weeks, when faced with the harsh reality of the next publishing deadline and having to care for a sick son... I surrendered and never published again. 

A few months ago, I started writing a book for children. I... finished it! Text is there, graphics are there, it's even printed. I published it in a staggering amount of 2 copies, and my children love it.

Then I did it again. Another 2 self-published copies of a small book with a poem about an excavator and AI-generated illustrations.

I like the feeling of completing a project, but it doesn't come even close to the feeling I get while working on it. For me, doing creative stuff is way more fun than finishing it. Turns out I just love creating stuff and playing around.

Finishing a project can take a while. Days turn into weeks, weeks into years, years to decades. I believe it's perfectly fine. So do other people! Have you heard about Darwin's delay? 

> Darwin first mooted the theory of evolution in the late 1830's, but it was not until 1859 that it was finally published in his landmark work, the Origin Of Species. This mysterious 20-year interval has become known as "Darwin's delay" or "the long wait".

<br/>
What was he doing during those 20 years? He was, among other things, working on even more projects!
<br/>

> Darwin did not publish his inheritance theory of pangenesis for 27 years, his book on orchids was not published until 30 years after that research began, his book on cross fertilisation was published after 37 years, his notes on the development of his son were not published for 37 years and his book on earthworms 42 years after first conceiving of the idea.

This blog took just around a month to make. So it's a significant improvement compared to my other projects. Yes, it has bugs. Yes, it misses some of additional features. But I believe it meets the criteria of MVP <mark>(Minimum Viable Product)</mark>, so let's launch it! 

I had 3 goals in mind while making it:

1. Create my own space for sharing various stuff with the world ("world" in this case means you and my other 10 friends who will open it)
2. Learn something new.
3. Make it fun and memorable.

<br/>
1 -> checked. The site is live, you're able to open it.

2 -> checked. I learned how to mix React, svelte and other code I found on the web into a custom Astrojs website. AstroJS is awesome but my brain is pleased it managed to create a few more synaptic connections

3 -> checked. It seems to be that most blogs look very similar. This one stands out with... yellow! And desktop-like design. Of course, it's not something new, there are plenty of similar pages on the web. But it's rare enough to make it an exception in the boring "personal blog" space. At least for me.

I like the end result. I hope I won't be the only one!
