# 3-2-1... Backup! Launching Your Photos to Safety with the 3-2-1 Backup Rule
I recently embarked on a quest to "de-Google" my life. Ditching Chrome was easy (well, it's still Chromium-based, but with less spyware), and I've mostly kicked the Google search habit (except when I'm desperately lost in the digital wilderness). But breaking up with Google Photos? That's slightly harder, but it gives me time to *do it right*: privately and securely. One good approach for doing such backups is the 3-2-1 rule:

import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import image from "../../images/retro-desk.png";

<div class="md:float-right flex flex-col justify-center items-center ml-1 mb-1">
    <Image src={image} alt="Picture of a computer on a desk, window behind it, clouds outside" width={300} class="border-4 border-black" />
</div>

## The 3-2-1 Backup Rule: Your Digital Safety Net

1. Keep 3 copies (because bad luck comes in threes).
2. Use 2 types of media (diversify your digital portfolio!).
3. Store 1 copy remotely (in case your house becomes a crater).

## Why 3 copies?

Imagine your computer gets stolen, and your backup drive decides to retire early. Suddenly, you're living in a digital version of Cast Away, but instead of Wilson, you're talking to an empty hard drive case.

## Why 2 different media?

Different media types are crucial because technology changes faster than fashion trends. Those CDs you lovingly archived? About as useful as a floppy disk in a Tesla.

## Why 1 remote location?

And that remote backup? It's your digital bomb shelter. When the zombie apocalypse hits (or you accidentally spill coffee on everything you own), you'll thank me.

## Real-World Backup Strategies

- Phone photos → Home NAS → Mom's NAS (aka the "Trust Mom with Your Embarrassing Selfies" plan)
- Phone photos → Two cloud providers (for those who like their heads in multiple clouds)
- Phone photos → Home NAS → Cloud provider (The "From Pocket to Stratosphere" protocol)

## Is This Enough?

Well, unless you're planning to preserve your selfies for future civilizations like GitHub's Arctic Code Vault, probably.

And hey, if you're really worried, just remember: some state-sponsored agency has probably already backed up all your data without asking. See? Problem solved! (Just don't expect them to share their top-secret backup API anytime soon.)
